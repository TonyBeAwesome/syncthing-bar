syncthing-bar
=============

A little statusbar for http://syncthing.net/ on OSX

Be aware that i am NOT a swift developer. I am not even a cocoa developer. This is more or less a weekend experiment. It should be useable but the code is a mess :O (so much i can tell :D)

## To build/run

1. Clone the repository in X-Code
2. Download syncthing from http://syncthing.net/
3. Extract the archive
4. Locate the "syncthing" binary
5. Copy the binary to your syncthing-bar source repository
6. Open X-Code (binary/syncthing should NOT be marked RED anymore)
7. Hit the fancy play button :S
8. it SHOULD run :S
